The aim of the course is to allow the student to perform several realistic front-end projects as well as obtain skills in agile project methodology. The course benefits from knowledge from previous courses. The course consists of two parts, a project work (IG-G) which is performed in groups (5-6 students from FEND19 + 2 students from KVALIT19) and an individual assignment (IG-VG).
